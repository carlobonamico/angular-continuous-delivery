# Version everything

# I mean everything

# Start from the minimal possible thing

# And bring it to production



#Create artifacts (binaries)

Even HTML is a "binary", in the sense of a product that is propagated through stages.

## Simplest possible build
Create a zip file of the folder

```

```

## Archive it
Now, to a folder-based repository hosted on the CI server

Ideally, on artifact repository
* Nexus
* Artifactory
* npm 
* apt/yum repository

* Docker or Packer images? 

## Push it to TEST


## Who does this?
