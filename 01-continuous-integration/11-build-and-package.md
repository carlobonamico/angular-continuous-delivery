# Create artifacts (binaries)
Even HTML is a "binary", in the sense of a product that is propagated through stages.

## Simplest possible build
Create a zip file of the folder

## Archive it
Now, to a folder-based repository hosted on the CI server

Ideally, on artifact repository
* Nexus
* Artifactory
* npm 
* apt/yum repository

* Docker or Packer images? 

## Who does this?
Ci / CD server
