#Define stages

## In our lab we will use

* DEV -> development / build 
* QA ->
* PREPROD -> PRE-PRODUCTION
* PRODUCTION

For each stage, define
* deploy steps (as uniform as possible)

There has to be AT LEAST an environment to which you deploy the same artifact, with the same mechanisms, as in PROD
* PREPROD in our case

The other environments should be anyway as uniform as possible

# Stage Configuration 

## DEV

## QA

## PREPROD

## PROD

## Options for our production environment?
local http
docker container
cloud service?

# How do we move artifacts between stages?
