#Continuous Delivery principles

* The process for releasing/deploying software MUST be repeatable and reliable
* Automate everything!
* If somethings difficult or painful, do it more often
* Keep everything in source control
* Done means “released”
* Build quality in
* Everybody has responsibility for the release process
* Improve continuously

## Continuous Delivery Practices
* Build binaries only once
* Use precisely the same mechanism to deploy to every environment
* Smoke test your deployment
* If anything fails, stop the line!

## Low Risk Releases
* incremental
* decouple deployment and release
* focus on reducing batch size
* optimize for resilience
