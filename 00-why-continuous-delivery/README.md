## What problems do we have in releasing software? 
Do you like
* Staying up late to reconfigure a server?
* Having to rely on a server that took a week to setup, 
* and lose it because of an HD failure?
* Worrying about late and “frightening” releases?
* Spend hours/days troubleshooting
* Only to discover a minor difference in OS/app config
* Being unable to deploy a critical fix 
* because the upgrade process is so fragile and long that “it is better not to touch the system”? 

## What we look for
Discuss how to improve our software delivery...

Or better...
Find a better way of delivering value to users / customers

Reduce the time between when new needs arise and when IT satisfies them 
Even anticipating them...
 
## So, what is Continuous Delivery?
Discuss and make proposals...

## Enter Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery of value to users through 
a constant flow of incremental product/service 
improvements along the entire pipeline
              Idea → Implementation → Test → Deploy → Prod

In practice...

Always be ready (to deploy in production)

## Even more important: Continuous Delivery of feedback 
In the other direction, Continuous Delivery of 
* feedback about the system
* learning about the system
* learning about the service, the user, his/her needs

## Continuous Delivery is about learning
Basically, it allows you to learn faster.

## The problem
How long does it take to deploy a single line change into production?
(crucial question by Mary Poppendieck)

 Any work (code, configuration, setup...) available only to developers and testers, but not to users
Is (almost) worthless!

##Why this is not easy?
Time spent on tasks not effective 
* waste in Lean terms

Long Test times and costs ↔ Low Quality

Duration and complexity of deployments
* Releasing/Deployment means Risk
* So to avoid risk, we deploy less often...

* → This actually increases risk!

## Risk
* Trenord vs Metro Paris

## Reducing Risk

Continuous Delivery

Avoid huge manual changes
* 1-2 macro releases per year
* Each requiring seven people each one of which has intimate detail of a single issue in the process
* If they go wrong, long service outages
Unacceptable risk level

Transition to many incremental steps
*Every week / day / even hours...
*Less risky (and more easily rolled back)
*Ideally automated

##Advantages
Widely adopted at 
* IBM, Amazon, Facebook, Google, ...
* Premium Credit Limited, London Multi-Asset Exchange, Commonwealth Bank
* RCS Media Group, Siemens, HP
Best practice recommended by IBM and Toughtworks among many others. 

##WHY?
* IT + Business managed and improved together
* Decrease Lead Time
* Increase opportunities for Learning / Innovation / Optimization
* Achieve both Quality AND Productivity

## Why is it relevant for Angular / HTML5 applications?
