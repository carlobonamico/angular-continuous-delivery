## What's this all about?
You got captured by Angular power and simplicity, and have chosen it for your next project (or you are thinking about it). Creating a prototype with Data Binding, scopes and MVVM was relatively quick and easy. But what do you need to effectively complete and bring a complex application in Production?

A key factor in rapidly and reliably releasing innovative AngularJS applications is taking advantage of the "Testable by design" nature of the framework, and fully exploit it to implement Continuous Delivery practices on your front-end application.

After a very short introduction to the key principles, this code-driven workshop will help you jump into the action by collaboratively and iteratively implementing a Continuous Delivery pipeline for a simple but realistic AngularJS application, including 
* build automation with gulp 
* unit and integration testing with Jasmine and Karma 
* continuous integration with Jenkins or Go 
* end-to-end and acceptance testing with Cucumber and Protractor 
* production optimizations 
* deployment to cloud environments 
* logging and monitoring

## Approach
* Interactive lab
* Make as many questions as you like/need
* Take notes
* Stop me if I talk too much!

Also, try forming 2-3 people teams to simulate team dynamics.
